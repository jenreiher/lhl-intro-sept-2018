# *Words we learned so far:*

## W1D1
* __Web App__: A website that has a server behind it and has some data that is going to live somewhere in a database between times you visit.
* __The Cloud__: the cloud is essentially a computer that holds other 'virtual' computers within it. This is possible because computer processing power is powerful enough that we are able to split up a processor into several 'smaller virtual processors'.
* __Version Control__: a way of keeping track of changes in code across time or developers.
* __Git__: a type of version control that allows us to track changes and go back to previous versions.
* __GitHub__: an online cloud-based software to host git repos.
* __Front End__: the things the user sees - e.g. html, css, javascript
* __Back End__: the code that talks to the database and runs the web server, in our case ruby, rails & active record.
* __Database__: the technology that holds our data to be dynamically displayed on the page by our app.
* __Heroku__: a cloud based service that we can use to host web apps.
* __Open Source__: a type of technology where anyone can view or request a change to the software.
* __IDE__: Integrated Development Environment, a one stop shop for updating code, running your webserver and interacting with the commandline.
* __Cloud9__: our cloud-based IDE of choice for this course.
* __Boilerplate__: a basic set up to work with for any particular web app framework (e.g. Sinatra).
* __Stack__: the different technologies and languages to a working web application. Different companies have different "stacks".

## W1D2
* __Tags or Elements__: the different identifiers for HTML to help the web browser know how to interact with them.
* __HTML__: hyper text markup language, the basic structure of web pages.
* __Markup__: another word for html. 
* __Attributes__: Extra invisible mark up that we can add to text to tell the browser how to behave when the user interacts with it, such as the 'href' part of `<a href=""></a>` or the 'src' part of `<img src="">`.
* __Nested tags__: the way that we put one html tag inside the other to build up the structure of the page into sections.
* __The DOM__: the document object model - the way the the way your code and the browser interact.
* __Html tag__: the wrapper for the whole page.
* __Head tag__: information that the browser needs to display the website properly.
* __Body tag__: the content that is drawn to the DOM for the user.
* __Div tag__: a way to divide things on the page. These stack on top of each other by default.
* __Span tag__: a way to divide things on the page. These flow within the content on the page. 
* __Semantic tags__: we should try to use tag names to describe things so that the code is more human readable, and other technologies have an easier time interacting with your page in a meaningful way.  ke `<p>I'm a paragraph</p>` or a self-closing tag such as `<img src="..." >`
* __Nesting__: When you stuff HTML elements inside of other elements, that's called nesting. This is a common practice and in some occasions it's required such as in `<ul>` tags and `<form>` tags. Make sure to indent your code as you nest to make debugging.
