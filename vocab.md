# *Words we learned so far:*

## W1D1
* __Web App__: A website that has a server behind it and has some data that is going to live somewhere in a database between times you visit.
* __The Cloud__: the cloud is essentially a computer that holds other 'virtual' computers within it. This is possible because computer processing power is powerful enough that we are able to split up a processor into several 'smaller virtual processors'.
* __Version Control__: a way of keeping track of changes in code across time or developers.
* __Git__: a type of version control that allows us to track changes and go back to previous versions.
* __GitHub__: an online cloud-based software to host git repos.
* __Front End__: the things the user sees - e.g. html, css, javascript
* __Back End__: the code that talks to the database and runs the web server, in our case ruby, rails & active record.
* __Database__: the technology that holds our data to be dynamically displayed on the page by our app.
* __Heroku__: a cloud based service that we can use to host web apps.
* __Open Source__: a type of technology where anyone can view or request a change to the software.
* __IDE__: Integrated Development Environment, a one stop shop for updating code, running your webserver and interacting with the commandline.
* __Cloud9__: our cloud-based IDE of choice for this course.
* __Boilerplate__: a basic set up to work with for any particular web app framework (e.g. Sinatra).
* __Stack__: the different technologies and languages to a working web application. Different companies have different "stacks".
